TRANSFORM_RULE = (

	"function named exactly `transform` taking the raw result — the records array (Document List / "
	"API) or the doc (Document) — and RETURNING the new value. This is where you clean a field for "
	"display (strip HTML from rich text, format a datetime/currency, derive a label), returning records "
	"with the cleaned fields so the layout binds {{ dataItem.<field> }} directly. e.g. 'function transform(data) { return "
