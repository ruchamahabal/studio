"""Interactivity tools — wire behaviour onto EXISTING blocks: event handlers and
visibility conditions.

Both are client-side: the loop validates the ref against the WorkingTree, then emits
the op for the canvas to apply. For a block you are CREATING this turn, bake the
handler / condition into the block instead (add_block/generate_page 'events' and
'visibility' fields) — a new block has no id to target.

An event handler runs as a 'Run Script' action: arbitrary JS evaluated with the page's
script context in scope — the page script's bindings (refs are read/written via `.value`,
e.g. `counter.value++`), data sources, and `route`/`router`.
