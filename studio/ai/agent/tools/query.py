"""Selector tools: find and inspect blocks by structural filters.

`query_blocks` is server-side — it walks the turn's LIVE working tree (edits
already applied this turn included) and returns the matching blocks' ids
(+ component and full text). This
grounds bulk edits: instead of scanning the page context and hoping it catches
every block, the model asks for the exact set ("all text", "all Button") and gets
it deterministically, then applies one `update_blocks` call. Text is returned in
FULL — translation/rewrite needs every block's real copy.
